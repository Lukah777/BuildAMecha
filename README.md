Turn Based Strategy RPG, with customizable characters 

This is a Demo and a work in progress that is currently ongoing.

You control your character with the mouse; you click on highlighted tiles to move and pick an ability from your hot bar that you have equipped from the info menu, then select a highlighted spot to attack. If you do not want to attack, you can select the ability.

Your goal is to infiltrate the enemy's base and destroy their reactors.

Each enemy you kill will grant you half of an upgrade point, which you can use to unlock new equipment and repair yourself to full health.

You can unlock new equipment and equip it to different body parts in the Info menu.

Your hot bar consists of your two equipped weapons, your ultimate, which is equipped in your core, and your two shoulders. 

Not all equipment has an active ability that you can activate from your hot bar, but it will grant a passive ability.

Shields are directional depending on where they are equipped: chest north, core south, shoulder 1 west, and shoulder 2 east.

Shields recharge at the start of your turn.
